# My configs for git repos

In this folder are my config files which I use for the following git repos:
- dmenu -> [arieboven/dmenu](https://github.com/arieboven/dmenu)
- dwm -> [arieboven/dwm](https://github.com/arieboven/dwm)
- dwmblocks -> build from [torrinfail](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks)
- st -> [arieboven/st](https://github.com/arieboven/st)

---
These config files need to be copied or hard linked to the builds in order to make the build.

**! keep note !** If you just copy the config, git will no longer track the changes you made.
